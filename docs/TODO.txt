Scrappy TODO list

- preprocessor, includes
	- gas .ifdef works on normal symbols, not macro space
- incbin
- label redefinition should be first-wins and warn on attempt to redefine.
- .equ should allow redefinition.. check detailed semantics.
- local labels with forward/backward refs a-la gas
- org, align (fill/resv?)
- relocation support, binary format, linking?
	- possible optimised assemble-and-link multiple files
	- raises the issue of symbol scope, headers
	- gas does auto extern..? don't do this?
	- .global (and .globl?)
- magic nextword
- .err .end

blackbox
========
- fix blackbox error if reference binary present but no generated binary
- better blackbox hex diff view; internal perl? would need no temp files and
  be portable.
