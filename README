This is an assembler for the DCPU-16 processor, see http://0x10c.com/

Written by Jon Povey <jon@leetfighter.com> for fun and to learn lex and yacc.
Comments, patches, abuse welcome.

If you have lex and yacc (flex and bison), GNU make and GCC installed,
then "make" may build an assembler for you.
Far from release quality, but enjoy.

This project includes GPLv2 parts from the Linux kernel, so I suppose I'll
release it GPLv2.

TODO list:
- actual working labels
- optimised small literals in the presence of labels
- compile-time constant expressions [labela - 0x20 + I]
- freeing of malloc()'d things (whoops!)
- maybe macros

Fallen my friend, enjoy.
