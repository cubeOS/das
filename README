This is an assembler for the DCPU-16 processor, see http://0x10c.com/

Written by Jon Povey <jon@leetfighter.com> for fun and to learn lex and yacc.
Comments, patches, abuse welcome.

If you have lex and yacc (flex and bison), GNU make and GCC installed,
then "make" may build an assembler for you.
Feed assembly into stdin, binary will be deposited in out.bin (for now).
Far from release quality, but enjoy.

This project includes GPLv2 parts from the Linux kernel, so I suppose I'll
release it GPLv2.

DONE list:
- optimised small literals in the presence of symbols
- case-insensitivity for input instructions, register names
- strings and DATs and things
- pretty printed annotated assembler output with PC and machine code
- freeing of most malloc()'d things

TODO list:
- command-line options
- compile-time constant expressions [symbol - 0x20 + I]
- fix probable bitstream bug when short literal is forced long
    (will only show up when (expr - symbol) form is supported)
- free() symbols
- maybe macros
- support local symbols?
- label redefinition semantics maybe unusual (latest wins)
