This is an assembler for the DCPU-16 processor, see http://0x10c.com/

Written by Jon Povey <jon@leetfighter.com> for fun and to learn lex and yacc.
Comments, patches, abuse welcome.

If you have lex and yacc (flex and bison), GNU make and GCC installed,
then "make" may build an assembler for you.
Feed assembly into stdin, binary will be deposited in out.bin (for now).

This project includes GPLv2 parts from the Linux kernel, so I suppose I'll
release it GPLv2.

Features:
- Spec 1.7 compliant
- Case-insensitive regarding opcodes and register names
- Compile-time constant expressions supporting most C arithmetic and bitwise
  operators, and parentheses e.g.
	SET A, [(labelA - labelB) * 0xff >> 3]
	DAT label + 2
- Strings support C escape sequences e.g. "\x0f\t1f CHARACTERS\n\0"
- Optimised small literals in the presence of symbols
- Pretty printed annotated assembler output with PC and machine code
- Little/big endian output switch

TODO list:
- Fix and automate tests
- Write some clues for new users
- Macros
- Local symbols
- Work on supporting llvm-dcpu16
- Revisit label redefinition semantics (latest wins, maybe unusual)
- Nicer warnings and errors
- Error on undefined symbol (instead of pretending it's zero)
- Hint register EX if symbol 'O' is found but undefined
